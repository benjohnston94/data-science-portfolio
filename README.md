* [Cleaning employee exit surveys](https://github.com/benjohnston94/data_science_portfolio/blob/master/Cleaning%20employee%20exit%20surveys/Cleaning%20employee%20exit%20surveys.ipynb): Used Python to clean, transform and merge data from two separate employee resignation surveys.
* [Machine learning to differentiate dogs and cats](https://github.com/benjohnston94/data_science_portfolio/blob/master/Machine%20learning%20to%20differentiate%20dogs%20and%20cats/Machine%20learning%20to%20differentiate%20between%20cats%20and%20dogs.ipynb): Using tensorflow, normalised images of cats and dogs in a dataset, created a train and test dataset, and trained and optimised a machine learning model which I then used to guess my own images of dogs and cats.
* [Normalising a database](https://github.com/benjohnston94/data-science-portfolio/blob/master/Normalising%20a%20database/Project:%20SQL%20database%20design.ipynb): Used SQLite3 in Python to join datasets from different CSV files, design and create a normalised schema, and insert data into new tables.
* [Finding market opportunities using SQL](https://github.com/benjohnston94/data-science-portfolio/blob/master/Analysing%20market%20opportunities%20(SQL)/Project:%20Analysing%20market%20opportunities%20with%20SQL.ipynb): Used SQLite3 in Python to join database tables, analyse data and identify market opportunities. Visualised results using matplotlib.
* [Analysing income based on university majors](https://github.com/benjohnston94/data_science_portfolio/blob/master/Analysing%20income%20based%20on%20university%20major/Analysing%20income%20based%20on%20university%20major.ipynb): Using data about graduate income levels, utilised the matplotlib module in Python to practice visualising data in a variety of ways.
